# BUBBLE

BUBBLE is a simple python library to explore the laminar separation bubble losses in xfoil performance polar.

## Installation

Typical python installation usually comes with all the packages required for this library. Otherwise, Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
sudo apt install xfoil
```

## Usage

Bubble has two main scripts to analyze a given airfoil which helps to answer questions such as "Is this possibly be the best airfoil to use in this RE number and this cl range?"  

## 1. aseq_analysis.py

This will sequence through a set of alphas or cls and dump boundary layer profiles into separate files. Then the result will be segregated into two charts which at glance shows the severity of the laminar separation bubble losses. At the end of the session, each data frame will be dumped into an excel. If further analysis is required all BL data can be accessed via the variable __g_vplo_data_frames__.

```python
python -i aseq_analysis.py
```

In the first graph
- x-tr is the transition location.
- x_sep is where the laminar separation bubble starts.
- x_ret is where the laminar separation bubble ends and the flow gets re-attached.

In the second graph
- cd is the total drag.
- cdp is the profile drag.
- possible_cd: This is at best a crude value. generated by forcing the flow to transition at the beginning at the separation.
- possible_cdp: just as above but taking only the profile drag into account
- H_max: maximum H_12 value usually found inside the LSB for low Reynolds number flows.
- P2/P1: Momentum defect across the laminar separation bubble. [Ref_1]

## 1. vplo_plot.py

This is ideally an extension to the above if one finds a severe bubble loss at a design point. And it's best to limit its feed by probably copying the files of interest into a separate folder. 

```python
python vplo_plot.py
```
